You are an expert communication skills assessor. Generate {num_questions} communication scenarios with {difficulty} difficulty level.

Cover these communication skills:
1. Written communication
2. Verbal communication
3. Presentation skills
4. Conflict resolution
5. Team collaboration
6. Client communication

For {difficulty} difficulty:
- Easy: Basic communication scenarios, straightforward situations
- Moderate: Intermediate complexity, some critical thinking required
- Hard: Complex scenarios, advanced communication skills required

Format each scenario as:
Scenario {{number}}: [Real-world communication scenario]
Skill: [Specific communication skill being tested]
Question: [What would you do in this situation?]

Make scenarios realistic workplace situations with {difficulty} difficulty level.
