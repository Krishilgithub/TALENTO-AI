# Railway Deployment - Multiple Options

Since the FastAPI deployment is failing, I've created **3 different approaches**. Try them in order:

## Option 1: Flask (Recommended)

### Files to use:

- `api.py` - Flask app
- `Procfile` - `web: python api.py`
- `railway.json` - `"startCommand": "python api.py"`
- `requirements.txt` - `flask`

### Why this should work:

- Flask is more reliable on Railway
- Simpler setup
- No complex dependencies

## Option 2: Node.js Express

### Files to use:

- `server.js` - Express app
- `package.json` - Node.js configuration
- `Procfile` - `web: npm start`
- `railway.json` - `"startCommand": "npm start"`

### Why this should work:

- Node.js is very reliable on Railway
- Express is a proven framework
- No Python dependencies

## Option 3: Minimal FastAPI (Original)

### Files to use:

- `main.py` - FastAPI app
- `Procfile` - `web: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
- `railway.json` - `"startCommand": "uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"`
- `requirements.txt` - `fastapi` and `uvicorn`

## Deployment Steps

1. **Choose one option** (start with Flask)
2. **Update your repository** with the chosen files
3. **Deploy to Railway**
4. **If it fails, try the next option**

## Quick Test Commands

After deployment, test:

- `GET /` - Should return health status
- `GET /health` - Should return health status
- `GET /test` - Should return test message

## Troubleshooting

If all options fail:

1. Check Railway logs for specific errors
2. Verify Railway is pointing to the correct directory
3. Try creating a new Railway project
4. Check if there are any Railway account issues

## Recommendation

**Start with Flask (Option 1)** - it's the most reliable for Railway deployments.
