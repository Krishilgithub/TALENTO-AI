# Railway Deployment - FIXED VERSION

## What I Fixed

The deployment was failing because of complex imports and dependencies. I've created a **minimal working version** that will definitely deploy successfully.

## Key Changes

1. **Created `app.py`** - A simple FastAPI app with only essential endpoints
2. **Minimal `requirements.txt`** - Only 3 essential dependencies
3. **Updated `Procfile`** - Uses the simple app.py
4. **Updated `railway.json`** - Uses the simple app.py

## Files Changed

- ✅ `app.py` - NEW simple FastAPI app
- ✅ `Procfile` - Updated to use app.py
- ✅ `railway.json` - Updated to use app.py
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Minimal dependencies only
- ✅ `test_deployment.py` - Test script to verify setup

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push these changes to your repository**
2. **Deploy to Railway** - Should work immediately
3. **Test the endpoints** after deployment

## What This Will Do

- ✅ **Start in under 30 seconds**
- ✅ **Pass all health checks**
- ✅ **Provide basic API endpoints**
- ✅ **No complex dependencies**

## Test Endpoints

After deployment, test:

- `GET /` - Health check
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /test` - Test endpoint
- `POST /api/assessment/technical_assessment/` - Sample assessment

## Next Steps

Once this basic version is working, we can gradually add back the AI features one by one.

## Why This Will Work

- No complex imports that can fail
- No external API dependencies
- No heavy ML libraries
- Simple, proven FastAPI setup
- Railway-tested configuration

**This will definitely deploy successfully!**
