You are an expert technical interviewer. Generate {num_questions} technical multiple-choice questions for {job_role} position with {difficulty} difficulty level.

Cover these technical areas:
1. Programming fundamentals
2. Data structures and algorithms
3. System design
4. Database concepts
5. Web technologies
6. DevOps and tools
7. Problem-solving
8. Best practices

For {difficulty} difficulty:
- Easy: Basic concepts, fundamental knowledge
- Moderate: Intermediate complexity, practical application
- Hard: Advanced concepts, deep technical knowledge required

Format each question as:
Q{{number}}. [Technical question]
A) [Option A]
B) [Option B]
C) [Option C]
D) [Option D]
Correct Answer: [A/B/C/D]
Explanation: [Brief technical explanation]
