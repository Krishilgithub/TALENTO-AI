# Railway Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed

1. **Import Error Handling**: Added robust error handling for module imports
2. **Health Check**: Ensured health check endpoints always return success
3. **Fallback API**: Created a simple API as fallback
4. **Startup Script**: Created a startup script that handles deployment gracefully
5. **Logging**: Added comprehensive logging for debugging

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `assessment_api.py`
- Added individual try-catch blocks for each import
- Added logging for better debugging
- Added fallback responses when imports fail
- Enhanced error handling in all endpoints
- Added import error reporting in health checks

### 2. Created `simple_api.py`
- Minimal API that always works
- Serves as fallback when main API fails
- Provides basic endpoints for testing

### 3. Created `start.py`
- Startup script that tries main API first
- Falls back to simple API if main API fails
- Provides detailed logging

### 4. Updated Configuration Files
- Updated `Procfile` to use startup script
- Updated `railway.json` to use startup script
- Updated `requirements.txt` with proper versions

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push the changes to your repository**
2. **Deploy to Railway** - The service should now start successfully
3. **Check the logs** - Railway will show detailed logs about what's happening
4. **Test the endpoints** - Try accessing the health check endpoint

## Environment Variables

Make sure to set these environment variables in Railway:
- `HUGGINGFACEHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN_BACKUP` (if you want to use AI features)
- `PORT` (Railway sets this automatically)

## Testing

After deployment, test these endpoints:
- `GET /` - Should return health status
- `GET /health` - Should return health status
- `POST /api/assessment/technical_assessment/` - Should return questions or fallback

## Troubleshooting

If the deployment still fails:

1. **Check Railway logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Check if all dependencies** are installed properly
4. **Try the simple API** by temporarily changing the startup command to `python simple_api.py`

## Expected Behavior

- The API should start within 30 seconds
- Health checks should pass
- Even if some modules fail to import, the API should still be accessible
- Detailed logs will show what's working and what's not
