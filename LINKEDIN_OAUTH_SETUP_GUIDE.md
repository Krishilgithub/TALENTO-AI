## ðŸš¨ **Why LinkedIn Integration Isn't Working**

You're getting a "LinkedIn Client ID not configured" error because the LinkedIn OAuth credentials are missing from your environment variables.

## ðŸ“‹ **Step-by-Step Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Create LinkedIn App**

1. **Go to LinkedIn Developer Portal**

   - Visit: https://www.linkedin.com/developers/
   - Sign in with your LinkedIn account

2. **Create a New App**

   - Click "Create App"
   - Fill in the required information:
     - **App Name**: `Talento AI` (or any name you prefer)
     - **LinkedIn Page**: You'll need to create or select a LinkedIn company page
     - **App Logo**: Upload your Talento AI logo
     - **Legal Agreement**: Check the box to agree

3. **Configure App Settings**
   - After creating the app, go to the "Auth" tab
   - Add authorized redirect URLs:
     ```
     http://localhost:3000/auth/linkedin/callback
     ```
   - Request the following scopes:
     - `r_liteprofile` (to read profile info)
     - `w_member_social` (to post content)

### **Step 2: Get Your Credentials**

1. **Copy Client Credentials**

   - From the "Auth" tab, copy:
     - **Client ID** (shown at the top)
     - **Client Secret** (click "Show" to reveal)

2. **Update Your .env File**
   - Open your `.env` file
   - Replace the empty values:
   ```env
   LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id_here"
   LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret_here"
   LINKEDIN_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:3000/auth/linkedin/callback"
   ```

### **Step 3: Verify Setup**

1. **Restart Your FastAPI Server**

   ```bash
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   # Then restart:
   cd "Models\Assessment models"
   python assessment_api.py
   ```

2. **Test LinkedIn Connection**
   - Go to your app: http://localhost:3000/dashboard?tab=linkedin-post-generator
   - Click "Connect LinkedIn Account"
   - You should be redirected to LinkedIn for authorization

## ðŸ”§ **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: "Redirect URI Mismatch"**

- **Solution**: Make sure the redirect URI in your LinkedIn app matches exactly:
  ```
  http://localhost:3000/auth/linkedin/callback
  ```

### **Issue 2: "Insufficient Permissions"**

- **Solution**: Ensure your LinkedIn app has the following products enabled:
  - Sign In with LinkedIn
  - Share on LinkedIn

### **Issue 3: "App Not Verified"**

- **Solution**: For development, this is normal. For production, you'll need to verify your app with LinkedIn.
