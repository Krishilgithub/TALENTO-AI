# Project Execution Plan: LockedIn AI Clone

This document outlines the recommended phases and steps to build a LockedIn AI-like platform using Next.js, TypeScript, and modern web technologies.

---

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Planning

1. **Requirements Gathering**

   - Define core features and user stories.
   - Research competitors and finalize feature list.
   - Prepare wireframes or UI mockups for main pages.

2. **Tech Stack Finalization**

   - Confirm frontend, backend, and DevOps tools/libraries.
   - Set up a project repository (GitHub/GitLab).

3. **Initial Project Setup**
   - Initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript.
   - Set up version control (git).
   - Configure code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier).
   - Set up basic folder structure.

---

## Phase 2: UI/UX Foundation

1. **Install & Configure UI Library**

   - Choose and set up Tailwind CSS or Chakra UI.
   - Add global styles and theme configuration.

2. **Scaffold Main Pages**

   - Home (Hero, Features, Testimonials, Pricing, FAQ, Contact)
   - Dashboard (for logged-in users)
   - Authentication (Login, Register, Forgot Password)

3. **Reusable Components**

   - Navbar, Footer, Button, Card, Modal, etc.
   - Feature highlight sections with icons/illustrations.

4. **Responsive Design**
   - Ensure mobile and desktop responsiveness.

---

## Phase 3: Core Feature Implementation

1. **AI Copilot & Interview Simulation**

   - Integrate OpenAI API (or similar) for real-time Q&A.
   - Build chat interface for interview simulations.

2. **Resume Builder & Optimization**

   - Create forms for resume input (React Hook Form/Formik + Zod/Yup).
   - Integrate LLM for resume feedback and optimization.

3. **Coding Assistance**

   - Add coding question interface and code editor.
   - Integrate AI for code review and suggestions.

4. **Online Assessment & Question Prep**

   - Build practice modules for assessments.
   - Provide real-time feedback for behavioral/technical questions.

5. **Professional Meeting Tools**

   - Add tools for meeting preparation and feedback.

6. **Live Coaching & Video Interviewing**

   - Integrate video conferencing (e.g., WebRTC, third-party APIs).
   - Enable real-time chat/coaching (Socket.io/Ably).

7. **User Dashboard**
   - Track progress, schedule sessions, access resources.

---

## Phase 4: Backend & Integrations

1. **Backend Setup**

   - Set up Node.js/Express backend (if needed).
   - Connect to database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL).

2. **Authentication & Authorization**

   - Implement NextAuth.js or custom auth.
   - Secure user data and sessions.

3. **File Uploads**

   - Integrate Cloudinary or AWS S3 for resume uploads.

4. **Transactional Emails**

   - Set up SendGrid or Mailgun for notifications.

5. **Payments (if required)**
   - Integrate Stripe or Paddle for paid plans.

## Phase 4.1: Technical Assessment Model Integration

- Integrated a FastAPI backend to serve the technical assessment model, which generates MCQs from uploaded resumes.
- Connected the Next.js frontend to the backend, allowing users to upload resumes and view generated questions.
- Faced and resolved several issues:
  - Uvicorn not found: Installed and activated in the correct environment.
  - HuggingFace API key missing: Added `.env` and loaded it properly.
  - TypeErrors from model output: Refactored code to handle both list and dict outputs.
  - Output parsing failures: Improved prompt and error handling for robust JSON parsing.
  - Connection refused: Ensured backend was running and fixed all backend errors.
- Used `/docs` endpoint to test API and confirm backend was running.
- Restarted backend after every code change to ensure stability.

---

## Phase 5: Testing & Quality Assurance

1. **Unit & Integration Testing**

   - Write tests using Jest and React Testing Library.

2. **Component Documentation**

   - Use Storybook for UI component documentation.

3. **Accessibility & Performance**
   - Audit and improve accessibility (a11y).
   - Optimize performance (images, code splitting, etc.).

---

## Phase 6: Deployment & Monitoring

1. **CI/CD Setup**

   - Configure GitHub Actions for automated builds and tests.

2. **Deployment**

   - Deploy frontend (and backend, if any) to Vercel.

3. **Analytics & Monitoring**
   - Integrate Vercel Analytics or Google Analytics.
   - Set up error monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.).

---

## Phase 7: Launch & Iteration

1. **Beta Testing**

   - Invite early users for feedback.
   - Fix bugs and polish UX.

2. **Public Launch**

   - Announce and promote the platform.

3. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Gather user feedback.
   - Add new features and improvements.
