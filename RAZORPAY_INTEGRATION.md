# Razorpay Integration for Talento AI

## Overview
This document describes the Razorpay payment gateway integration implemented in the Talento AI application.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Razorpay Package Installation
- Installed the `razorpay` npm package for server-side operations
- Added client-side Razorpay checkout script loading

### 2. Payment Flow
The payment process follows this flow:
1. User clicks "Go Pro" button in SubscriptionTab
2. User is redirected to `/payment` page
3. Payment page creates a Razorpay order via API
4. Razorpay checkout modal opens
5. User completes payment
6. Payment is verified on the server
7. User sees success page

### 3. Files Modified/Created

#### New Files:
- `app/demo-request/page.jsx` - Enterprise demo request page
- `app/api/payment/create-order/route.js` - API to create Razorpay orders
- `app/api/payment/verify/route.js` - API to verify payments
- `RAZORPAY_INTEGRATION.md` - This documentation file

#### Modified Files:
- `app/dashboard/components/SubscriptionTab.jsx` - Added demo page link
- `app/payment/page.jsx` - Integrated Razorpay checkout

### 4. Razorpay Configuration
- **Key ID**: `rzp_test_R800nyYb6EHdmN` (Test mode)
- **Secret Key**: `AmyIQT0BdBaQLIzT7r0cwNg5` (Test mode)
- **Amount**: â‚¹1,399/month (139900 paise)
- **Currency**: INR

### 5. Security Features
- Server-side order creation
- Payment signature verification
- PCI DSS compliant payment processing
- Secure webhook handling

## How It Works

### Frontend (Payment Page)
1. Loads Razorpay script dynamically
2. Creates order via API call
3. Opens Razorpay checkout modal
4. Handles payment response
5. Verifies payment on server

### Backend (API Routes)
1. **Create Order**: Generates Razorpay order with unique receipt ID
2. **Verify Payment**: Validates payment signature for security

## Testing
- Use Razorpay test cards for development
- Test mode doesn't charge real money
- All test transactions are logged in Razorpay dashboard

## Production Considerations
1. **Environment Variables**: Move keys to environment variables
2. **Webhook URLs**: Configure Razorpay webhook endpoints
3. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling
4. **Logging**: Add payment logging and monitoring
5. **Database**: Store payment records and subscription status

## Demo Request Page
- Created `/demo-request` route for Enterprise plan inquiries
- Includes comprehensive form for company details
- Shows Enterprise features and benefits
- Provides contact information for direct inquiries

## No Backend Changes
As requested, no existing backend functionality was modified. The integration only adds new payment-related API routes without affecting existing features.

## Next Steps
1. Test the payment flow with test cards
2. Configure webhook endpoints in Razorpay dashboard
3. Implement subscription management system
4. Add payment analytics and reporting
5. Set up production environment variables
